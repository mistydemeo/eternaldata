## Description

Appears to contain the game's data, in a packed format. Has some superficial similarities to the format used in the PlayStation version, with 2 appearing similar to DATA.PAK and 1 appearing similar to DATA.IDX.

Font Information  
====================  
16x16 Font used for text boxes is located at 0x3112840 (if you believe that crystal tile 2 gives accurate offsets...)  
Font Format is: 4 color 2bpp  (same format as Saturn SSS/SSSC, but different font arrangement)  
I believe this is rendered using VDP2, need to confirm with Yabause.  

Unknown yet if this is the same Font used during Cinematics.  That font is rendered to VDP1 (verified in yabause).  


Game Script (Preliminary)  
============================  
Debugging one of the first dialogs with Ruby at the start of the game:  

LORAM text located at 0x2_006B0 (lines up with 16x16 font offsets)  

0039 0008 0008 0008 9010     006A  
 a   ~     ~    ~  (space)    

It would appear that the script in use for the first portion of the game is loaded into LO Work RAM at 0x2_00000  
This same script appears in binary file "2" at offset 0x047A_1000  

The game script itself is not identical to the system used in SSS/SSSC, it appears to be a new format.  16-bits are still used for each Japanese character and it does not appear that compression is used.  

Some Control Codes For dialog text:  
1000 is enter  
BA00 is wait for button press  

File Pointer for script appears to use 32-bit Longword location 0x06042208
